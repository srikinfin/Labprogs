input : program names, single word
action: add the program name as 'id' value and label value of a form tag,  and...
	insert this resulting string into a html file, inside its form tag.

misc: dynamically changeable html file 


eg;   program name is  ----  guake   ----- entered through a web page form

	and by action, the same web page adds a checkbox of label  guake in itself.

	when checkbox is check and submitted,
	another modified string containing  "guake" should be sent to another shell script file.
	as in "sudo apt-get install guake" to a shell script file  "buntu.sh"
